Playing with FiveThirtyEight's dataset with R

FiveThirtyEight www.fivethirtyeight.com is a great website and they perform many data driven analyses. 
They release a lot of the data they use on their GitHub account and repackage them into a nice R package.
Leveraging upon it, I am reanalyzing some datasets
